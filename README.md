# jira-story-points

Adds a set of Fibonacci sequence shortcut buttons to the story details page.
Lets you quickly and easily set or remove the story points for an issue.

Designed to work with Jira Server editions (i.e. not Jira Cloud). May also work on Jira Data Centre (not tested).
Works using any custom field named "Story Points". If no such field exists, the script will do nothing.

Not made, endorsed, or supported by Jira or Atlassian.
